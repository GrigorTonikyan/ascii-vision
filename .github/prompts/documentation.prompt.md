# Documentation Review and Update

## Purpose

Analyze the codebase and recent changes. Review all project documentation for relevancy and  
accuracy. Ensure that all documents are professional, accurate, and reflect the current state  
of the project.

## Analysis Checklist

- [ ] Review recent codebase changes (commits, pull requests, merges)
- [ ] Cross-check documentation files for accuracy and completeness
- [ ] Validate that examples and code snippets are correct and functional
- [ ] Ensure technical terms and instructions are clear and professional
- [ ] Confirm documentation follows project style and formatting guidelines

## Update Tasks

- [ ] Update documentation to reflect new features, changes, or removals
- [ ] Remove or update any outdated or irrelevant information
- [ ] Add missing documentation for new functionality
- [ ] Update API documentation and type definitions
- [ ] Refresh installation and setup instructions

## Quality Standards

- Follow [UPM Development Guidelines](../instructions/general.instructions.md)
- Use clear, concise, and professional language
- Maintain consistency across all documentation files
- Reference related documentation or code where appropriate
- Include practical examples and use cases

## Example Workflow

> After merging feature X, update the relevant sections in the README and API docs to describe  
> the new functionality. Remove references to deprecated methods and update code examples.

## Files to Review

Common documentation files that require regular updates:

- `README.md` - Main project documentation
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Version history and release notes
- `.github/docs/` - Technical documentation
- Inline code documentation and JSDoc comments
- API documentation and type definitions
